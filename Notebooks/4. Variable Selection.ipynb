The bidirectional stepwise selection combines forward selection, which starts with no variables in the model and adds variables that capture the largest improvement, and backward elimination, which starts with all candidate variables and removing the least significant variables.  One feature of the stepwise WLS estimation is that the number of selected variables will change, as predictors come in and out of the selected set.  In comparison, in WLS without variable selection, all of the variables always get non-zero weights, even if they only contribute marginally in a given sample.

On 04/30/2003, we re-estimate our model using an expanding window, from 06/01/1990 to 04/30/2003, to obtain new parameter values which we use for next month’s equity premium forecasts.  We continue to re-estimate our model monthly and make one-month equity premium forecasts every day until the end of the sample.  We publish a summary of our model output in our Daily Report.

    "\n",
    "Merriam-Webster defines \"parsimony\" as\n",
    "\n",
    "1. the quality of being careful with money or resources : \"thrift the necessity of wartime parsimony\"\n",
    "2. the quality or state of being stingy: \"The charity was surprised by the parsimony of some larger corporations.\"\n",
    "3.  economy in the use of means to an end; especially : economy of explanation in conformity with Occam's razor the scientific law of parsimony dictates that any example of animal behavior should be interpreted at its simplest, most immediate level \n",
    "\n",
    "The third one above and an \"economy of explanation\" seems to fit our context. So this goes back to what we originally said about wanting a model that is as simple as possible. Simplicity (economy) can take many forms including the type of model (simple linear regression versus a recurrent neural network), estimation frequency (coefficient re-estimation frequently versus only once), and number of variables (a few versus a billion).\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, so by Occam's razor we should prefer simplicity which can be interpreted as prefering fewer explanatory variables to more explanatory variables. Occam aside, why should we prefer that? Ingo Ruczinski, some guy with on the internet, says there are lots of reasons to prefer simplicity:\n",
    "\n",
    " * We want to explain the data in the simplest way — redundant predictors should be removed. The principle of Occam’s Razor states that among several plausible explanations for a phenomenon, the simplest is best. Applied to regression analysis, this implies that the smallest model that fits the data is best.\n",
    " * Unnecessary predictors will add noise to the estimation of other quantities that we are interested in. Degrees of freedom will be wasted.\n",
    " * Collinearity is caused by having too many variables trying to do the same job.\n",
    " * Cost: if the model is to be used for prediction, we can save time and/or money by not measuring redundant predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~iruczins/teaching/jf/ch10.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Collinearity is a statistical term for having many variables that are all versions of closely related things (ex: industrial production, new car production, ship building, tractor manufacturing, etc). From a statistical perspective, collinearity can make doing statistics difficult (such as in muddying the measured statsitical significance of your explanatory variables).\n",
    "\n",
    "To the list above I'd also add that too many variables increases the risk of overfitting. Given enough explanatory variables we could almost perfectly fit any dataset. For instance, just by random chance we might find that a lot of variables have been correlated to historical stock market returns. So if we include enough random variables, we'll likely include one of those variables that \"accidentally\" predicted the market in the past but there is no rationale to believe it'll predict the market in the future. To be safe (and parsimonious) we should include as few variables in our model as possible to avoid the chance of introducing spurious correlations (but if you like spurious correlations you can find a few here http://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)\n",

    "### Stepwise Variable Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "Back in Notebook 1 we spoke a little about Stepwise Variable Selection. Let's expand on that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of Stepwise Variable Selection is that we want to only add variables to a model if their contribution in beneficial.  Let's say you have 10 variables you can possibly put into a linear regression model. You start by only including var1 and record how good of a model it is. Then you try var2, then var, etc. After trying them all, you pick the variable that had the best performance and you add that to your model. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then you iterate through the remaining nine variables and find which one, in combination with the variable you added in the previous round, produces the best model. Keep going until you hit some stopping criteria that you define (eg the performance only increases by an arbitrarily small amount).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do forward variable selection whereby you start with zero variables and add variables one at a time. Or backwards variable selection whereby you start with all variables and subtract variables one at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "In bi-directional stepwise variable selection we combine the forward and backward procedures. Hull et al. aren't clear on how they implement bi-directional variable selection and the internet provides many variations on the concept. Here's one where you start with all variables intitially included in the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is one of alternation between choosing the least significant variable to drop and then re-considering all dropped variables (except the most recently dropped) for re-introduction into the model. This means that two separate significance levels must be chosen for deletion from the model and for adding to the model. The second significance must be more stringent than the first.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.stat.ubc.ca/~rollin/teach/643w04/lec/node43.html\n",
    "\n",
    "So in this process, at each iteration we try to drop a variable and then try to add back in a variable (where the performance gain for adding or dropping is satisfied). Why would we ever add back a variable that was previously dropped? Well maybe it's because we don't want to include var1 (say industrial production) when we also are including var6 (unemployment rate) in our model. But as we progress through the stepwise variable selection process, we might find that we end up dropping the unemployment rate from our model which then \"makes room\" for including industrial production. \n",
    "\n",
    "We've been a bit vague in the above discussion by what we mean in terms of model performance. How you choose to measure that is really up to you. Maybe it's statistical significance, or gain in R^2, or drop in RMSE. For Hull et al., they choose to use the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). \n",

The goal should be to minimize the calculated AIC value where a better model fit lowers the metric but more explanatory variables increase the metric. For us parsimony-preferring people, the AIC is a good metric to use and helps us pick between competing models (should we use a model that fits very well but includes 50 variables or a model that fits ok and only includes 5 variables).\n",

    "### Which Variables are the Most Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine that you have a model that does a good job of predicting the S&P 500 based on 15 explanatory variables (say the ones selected by Hell et al.). You go to an investor and offer to manage their money using your strategy. You say \"Look at all the money I can make you based on the historical performance.\" The investor is undoubtedly impressed but will inevitably want to know more about what's underneath the hood of your strategy before giving you money and therefore will ask \"which variables are most important when you make your prediction?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a bit of a hard question and there are several \"reasonable\" ways of approaching a solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hull et al. reference the method by Lindeman, Merenda, and Gold. Here's a description of an implementation of their method written for R: \n",
    "\n",
    "\"R^2 represents the proportion of variance explained by a set of predictors. If one can estimate the proportion of the R^2 contributed by each individual predictor, the one with larger R^2 would be more important to explain the outcome variable. However, the difficulty lies in how to get the R^2 for each predictor.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most intuitive way to decompose the total R^2 is to add the predictors to the regression model sequentially. Then, the increased R^2 can be considered as the contribution by the predictor just added. However, this method depends on the sequence the predictors are added if the predictors are correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "The lmg approach is based on sequential R^2 but takes care of the dependence on orderings by averaging over orderings. For example, for a model with 4 predictors, there are a total of 24 orderings. For each ordering, the contributed R^2 can be calculated. lmg is the average of the R^2 across the 24 orderings.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "https://advstats.psychstat.org/book/mregression/importance.php\n",
