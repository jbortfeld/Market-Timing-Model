    "\n",
    "Return predictability is a central issue in financial economics. Evidence of stock return\n",
    "predictability is supported by numerous academic research papers. Early work includes\n",
    "Campbell and Shiller (1988a, 1988b) and Fama and French (1988). More recently, several\n",
    "papers have presented convincing arguments in favor of predictability (Cochrane, 2005; Rapach,\n",
    "Strauss, and Zhou, 2010; Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou, 2009; Jiang et al. 2015). Compared to\n",
    "the large body of work on statistical evidence of return predictability, there is relatively little\n",
    "work on the portfolio construction of market-timing strategies based on the proposed return\n",
    "predictors, or the economic importance for an investor who has the resources to engage in a\n",
    "market-timing strategy. Understanding the practical economic significance of market timing\n",
    "allows us to view predictability from the investor’s perspective rather than that of the\n",
    "econometrician. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hull and Qiao (2017) illustrate the economic importance of return predictability through a\n",
    "market-timing strategy. They select from a set of 20 well-known return predictors, and combine\n",
    "these variables using correlation screening. They focus on the six-month future market excess\n",
    "returns. In the market-timing strategy proposed by Hull and Qiao (2017), the investor can\n",
    "achieve a Sharpe ratio of 0.85 from 2001 through 2015 by taking tactical positions in the S&P\n",
    "500, compared to a buy-and-hold Sharpe ratio of 0.21 over the same period. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the work of Hull and Qiao (2017), we present a novel market-timing strategy. Similar\n",
    "to Hull and Qiao (2017), we combine a large set of forecasting variables to allow for a diverse\n",
    "information set, and construct a reliable market-timing model. We consider several variables not\n",
    "used in Hull and Qiao (2017) including change in inflation, commodity price, housing starts,\n",
    "exchange rates, FRB Loan Officer Survey, delinquencies, and the change in unemployment rate.\n",
    "We discuss these variables in more detail in the data section. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Hull and Qiao (2017), we focus on forecasting one-month market excess returns rather\n",
    "than six-month market excess returns. The focus on shorter-term predictability renders many\n",
    "classic return predictors (such as price ratios) less useful in favor of variables that capture higher frequency movements in expected returns. Furthermore, several new variables, not included in\n",
    "Hull and Qiao (2017), capture macroeconomic conditions. Although macroeconomic variables\n",
    "are typically thought of as slow-moving, we find that combining them results in forming accurate\n",
    "forecasts of next-month excess market returns, which in turn helps us build a short-term markettiming\n",
    "model. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this paper is to build a predictive model for the one-month future market excess\n",
    "returns and construct a market-timing strategy. We consider 15 return predictors. Some of these\n",
    "variables have been proposed in the predictability literature, whereas others, in our reading of the\n",
    "literature, are unique to our paper. We use weighted least squares (WLS) regression with\n",
    "stepwise variable selection to build a forecasting model for next month’s market excess returns.\n",
    "We estimate our forecasting model at the end of every month using an expanding window.\n",
    "Within each month, we hold the model parameters constant and form forecasts using updated\n",
    "predictor values each day. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with our forecasting model, we construct a monthly market-timing strategy by\n",
    "transforming forecast values into investable positions. The restrictions we place on our\n",
    "transformation include 1) 0% invested in the S&P 500, and 100% invested in T-bills when the\n",
    "equity premium forecast is zero, 2) 100% invested in the S&P 500 when the forecast of the\n",
    "equity premium is equal to its historical average, and 3) maximum of 150% exposure to the S&P\n",
    "500 when the equity premium forecast is above its historical average. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We transform our equity premium forecast into investable positions to satisfy these conditions,\n",
    "and scale the positions to be inversely proportional to the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of our\n",
    "statistical model. The inverse of RMSE scaling can be interpreted as our confidence in our\n",
    "forecasts. If the RMSE of our fitted model is large, we are less confident and want to decrease\n",
    "our position, whereas if the RMSE is small, we are more confident in our model and increase our\n",
    "position.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2003 to 2017, the one-month market-timing model achieves annualized returns of 16.6%\n",
    "with a Sharpe ratio of 0.92. In the same period, buy-and-hold S&P 500 had 10% annualized\n",
    "returns and a 0.46 Sharpe ratio. The maximum drawdown of the market-timing strategy is 20%\n",
    "compared to 55% for buy-and-hold. The one-month strategy works even better when combined with Hull and Qiao’s (2017) six-month model. A portfolio of equal investments in Hull and\n",
    "Qiao’s (2017) six-month model and our one-month model results in 15% annualized returns with\n",
    "a Sharpe ratio of 0.92, and a maximum drawdown of only 14%. The improvement in riskadjusted\n",
    "return for the combined model comes from diversification across models. The onemonth\n",
    "and six-month models complement each other. Drawdowns for each strategy occur at\n",
    "different times, and the two strategies underperform buy-and-hold in different years. Combining\n",
    "the two market-timing strategies forms a more stable and robust portfolio than either stand-alone\n",

    "So that was quite a lot. The intro provided background info, referenced past research, and provided a game plan for the rest of the paper. There are a few ideas the paper brought up that are worth expanding upon:\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"Evidence of stock return predictability is supported by numerous academic research papers.\"</i>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is possibly a controversial statement! Obviously money managers and people who want to charge you a fee will tell you that stock's are predictable, and that specifically, they can do the predicting for you. But there is a long history pitting those that think stocks are predictiable versus those that do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one side is the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH). At its code, the EMH is a theory that asset (stock) prices reflect all available information. Let's use an example: Let's say Apple's stock price is `$`100 at the end-of-the-day Monday. On Tuesday at 10am it is reported on CNBC that Apple lost the keys to their factory and cannot produce any more iPhones for the next month. The news is information and that information should therefore be incorporated into the price of Apple stock. Presumably the stock price will fall. Perhaps to `$`90, perhaps to `$`80, perhaps the stock even goes up to `$`110. We don't know and that's not really the point. The point is that the price reflects that information. A violation of EMH would be that the news comes out, people think it's bad for Apple but then no one buys or sells the stock because of that information and nothing happens to the stock price. \n",
