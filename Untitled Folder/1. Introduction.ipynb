    "1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Return predictability is a central issue in financial economics. Evidence of stock return\n",
    "predictability is supported by numerous academic research papers. Early work includes\n",
    "Campbell and Shiller (1988a, 1988b) and Fama and French (1988). More recently, several\n",
    "papers have presented convincing arguments in favor of predictability (Cochrane, 2005; Rapach,\n",
    "Strauss, and Zhou, 2010; Bollerslev, Tauchen, and Zhou, 2009; Jiang et al. 2015). Compared to\n",
    "the large body of work on statistical evidence of return predictability, there is relatively little\n",
    "work on the portfolio construction of market-timing strategies based on the proposed return\n",
    "predictors, or the economic importance for an investor who has the resources to engage in a\n",
    "market-timing strategy. Understanding the practical economic significance of market timing\n",
    "allows us to view predictability from the investor’s perspective rather than that of the\n",
    "econometrician.  <a href='#supplemental_content_1'> (supplemental content available!) </a> <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hull and Qiao (2017) illustrate the economic importance of return predictability through a\n",
    "market-timing strategy. They select from a set of 20 well-known return predictors, and combine\n",
    "these variables using correlation screening. They focus on the six-month future market excess\n",
    "returns. In the market-timing strategy proposed by Hull and Qiao (2017), the investor can\n",
    "achieve a Sharpe ratio of 0.85 from 2001 through 2015 by taking tactical positions in the S&P\n",
    "500, compared to a buy-and-hold Sharpe ratio of 0.21 over the same period. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the work of Hull and Qiao (2017), we present a novel market-timing strategy. Similar\n",
    "to Hull and Qiao (2017), we combine a large set of forecasting variables to allow for a diverse\n",
    "information set, and construct a reliable market-timing model. We consider several variables not\n",
    "used in Hull and Qiao (2017) including change in inflation, commodity price, housing starts,\n",
    "exchange rates, FRB Loan Officer Survey, delinquencies, and the change in unemployment rate.\n",
    "We discuss these variables in more detail in the data section. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike Hull and Qiao (2017), we focus on forecasting one-month market excess returns rather\n",
    "than six-month market excess returns. The focus on shorter-term predictability renders many\n",
    "classic return predictors (such as price ratios) less useful in favor of variables that capture higher frequency movements in expected returns. Furthermore, several new variables, not included in\n",
    "Hull and Qiao (2017), capture macroeconomic conditions. Although macroeconomic variables\n",
    "are typically thought of as slow-moving, we find that combining them results in forming accurate\n",
    "forecasts of next-month excess market returns, which in turn helps us build a short-term markettiming\n",
    "model. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal in this paper is to build a predictive model for the one-month future market excess\n",
    "returns and construct a market-timing strategy. We consider 15 return predictors. Some of these\n",
    "variables have been proposed in the predictability literature, whereas others, in our reading of the\n",
    "literature, are unique to our paper. We use weighted least squares (WLS) regression with\n",
    "stepwise variable selection to build a forecasting model for next month’s market excess returns.\n",
    "We estimate our forecasting model at the end of every month using an expanding window.\n",
    "Within each month, we hold the model parameters constant and form forecasts using updated\n",
    "predictor values each day. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Armed with our forecasting model, we construct a monthly market-timing strategy by\n",
    "transforming forecast values into investable positions. The restrictions we place on our\n",
    "transformation include 1) 0% invested in the S&P 500, and 100% invested in T-bills when the\n",
    "equity premium forecast is zero, 2) 100% invested in the S&P 500 when the forecast of the\n",
    "equity premium is equal to its historical average, and 3) maximum of 150% exposure to the S&P\n",
    "500 when the equity premium forecast is above its historical average. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We transform our equity premium forecast into investable positions to satisfy these conditions,\n",
    "and scale the positions to be inversely proportional to the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of our\n",
    "statistical model. The inverse of RMSE scaling can be interpreted as our confidence in our\n",
    "forecasts. If the RMSE of our fitted model is large, we are less confident and want to decrease\n",
    "our position, whereas if the RMSE is small, we are more confident in our model and increase our\n",
    "position.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "From 2003 to 2017, the one-month market-timing model achieves annualized returns of 16.6%\n",
    "with a Sharpe ratio of 0.92. In the same period, buy-and-hold S&P 500 had 10% annualized\n",
    "returns and a 0.46 Sharpe ratio. The maximum drawdown of the market-timing strategy is 20%\n",
    "compared to 55% for buy-and-hold. The one-month strategy works even better when combined with Hull and Qiao’s (2017) six-month model. A portfolio of equal investments in Hull and\n",
    "Qiao’s (2017) six-month model and our one-month model results in 15% annualized returns with\n",
    "a Sharpe ratio of 0.92, and a maximum drawdown of only 14%. The improvement in riskadjusted\n",
    "return for the combined model comes from diversification across models. The onemonth\n",
    "and six-month models complement each other. Drawdowns for each strategy occur at\n",
    "different times, and the two strategies underperform buy-and-hold in different years. Combining\n",
    "the two market-timing strategies forms a more stable and robust portfolio than either stand-alone\n",
    "strategy. <br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Our paper fits into the literature on return predictability. Many academic studies of return\n",
    "predictability focus on longer horizons of one or more years (Cochrane, 2008; Welch and Goyal,\n",
    "2008). A smaller number of articles examine forecasting horizons shorter than one year.\n",

    "Our paper is similar to Breen et al. (1989) who also try to illustrate the economic importance of\n",
    "return predictability from the investor’s perspective. Breen et al. (1989) calculates the value of\n",
    "market-timing to be worth 2% of the total assets under management. The authors construct their\n",
    "market-timing strategy using the negative relationship between stock returns and the nominal\n",
    "interest rate. We also put forward a market-timing model, but we consider a significantly larger\n",

    "So that was quite a lot. The intro provided background info, referenced past research, and provided a game plan for the rest of the paper. There are a few ideas the paper brought up that are worth expanding upon. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Can you predict the stock market? Smart People Say Yes... and Other Smart People Say No\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<i>\"Evidence of stock return predictability is supported by numerous academic research papers.\"</i> (Hull, Qiao, Bakosova, 2017)\n",
    "\n",
    "<i> \"Most academic studies have supported the validity of some version of the EMH\" </i> (Romero, Balch, 2014)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is possibly a controversial statement! Obviously money managers and people who want to charge you a fee will tell you that stock's are predictable, and that specifically, they can do the predicting for you. But there is a long history pitting those that think stocks are predictiable versus those that do not. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the one side is the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) which began to form in the 1960s. At its core, the EMH is a theory that asset (stock) prices reflect all available information. Let's use an example: Let's say Apple's stock price is `$`100 at the end-of-the-day Monday. On Tuesday at 10am it is reported on CNBC that Apple lost the keys to their factory and cannot produce any more iPhones for the next month. The news is information and that information should therefore be incorporated into the price of Apple stock. Presumably the stock price will fall. Perhaps to `$`90, perhaps to `$`80, perhaps the stock even goes up to `$`110. We don't know and that's not really the point. The point is that the price reflects that information. A violation of EMH would be that the news comes out, people think it's bad for Apple but then no one buys or sells the stock because of that information and nothing happens to the stock price. \n",
    "\n",
    "As stated above, the EMH is pretty simple but there are nuances that you can quibble over and quite a few profound consequences flow from EMH. In terms of nuance:\n",
    " * What constitutes \"available information\"? If something is on CNBC then everyone will know about it. But what if only 20 investors know about Apple's missing key debacle? What if only Apple employees know about it and they're prohibited by law from trading on that non-public information?\n",
    " * How quickly do prices reflect the information? Instantaneously? Over the course of the day?\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, there are three broad potential conclusions you could form if you believe in the idea that stock prices reflect all available information. All revolve around the idea that markets are competitive and that it is therefore hard to earn more profit than what is offered by just investing in the market itself. This means that while a lot of people will beat the market over short periods of time (say over the past one year), hardly anyone (perhaps even no one) will beat the market over very long periods (20 years? 30 years?). As stated by financial research firm Morningstar, the three main EMH versions are:  \n",
    "\n",
    " * The <b>weak form of EMH</b> assumes that current stock prices fully reflect all currently available security market information. It contends that past price and volume data have no relationship with the future direction of security prices. It concludes that <i>excess returns cannot be achieved using technical analysis</i>.\n",
    " * The <b>semi-strong form of EMH</b> assumes that current stock prices adjust rapidly to the release of all new public information. It contends that security prices have factored in available market and non-market public information. It concludes that <i>excess returns cannot be achieved using fundamental analysis</i>.\n",
    " * The <b>strong form of EMH</b> assumes that current stock prices fully reflect all public and private information. It contends that market, non-market and inside information is all factored into security prices and that no one has monopolistic access to relevant information. It assumes a perfect market and concludes that <i>excess returns are impossible to achieve consistently</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "http://www.morningstar.com/InvGlossary/efficient_market_hypothesis_definition_what_is.aspx\n",
    "\n",
    "TLDR: Simply put, all three versions say, to varying degrees, that it's hard to beat the market. \n",
    "\n",
    "The impact of the EMH is hard to overstate. It's common today to hear about \"passive investing\" where you don't try to pick individual stocks but rather buy an ETF or mutual fund based on a broad stock index and then hold it for long period. Those are all consequences of the EMH. In the popular press, Burton Malkiel of Princeton University wrote the 1973 bestseller <i> A Random Walk Down Wall Street: The Time-Tested Strategy for Successful Investing </i> and said \"a blindfolded monkey throwing darts ar the stock listings could select a portfolio that would do just as well as one selected by experts.\" The takeaway is that you shouldn't try to beat the market by picking what you think will be winning stocks (you'll probably end up far behind the market if you do) and instead just invest \"passively\" in the broad market itself by buying a fund that contains all stocks. A few years after publishing the first edition of A Random Walk Down Wall Street he went on to start some of the first passive index mutual funds at Vanguard, an asset manager that has grown to manage over `$`5 trillion by 2018. \n",
